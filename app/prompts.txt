YOUR MODEL: "Try Before You Buy"
Free users get:

Access to ALL programs (can browse everything)
First 4 workouts of any program for free
Full tracking and features during those 4 workouts

After 4 workouts:

Paywall appears: "Loving the results? Unlock the full program"
They're already invested (4 workouts = ~2 weeks in)
They've seen progress and built a habit
Much higher conversion rate


WHY THIS IS GENIUS
1. Removes the biggest barrier
❌ Bad model: "Pay $50 to see if you like this program"
✅ Your model: "Try it free, pay only if it's working"
2. Builds commitment before asking for money

After 4 workouts, they've:

Established a routine
Seen some progress (even small)
Gotten familiar with the exercises
Built emotional investment


Conversion rate: 15-30% vs 3-5% for upfront paywalls

3. No analysis paralysis

Users can try multiple programs
"Let me try Push/Pull/Legs AND Upper/Lower, see which I prefer"
Then buy the one they actually like

4. Word of mouth

"Dude, try this app, first 4 workouts are free"
Spreads organically because there's no risk

5. Showcases quality

Your programs sell themselves through the experience
Not through marketing copy

SMART ADDITIONS TO THIS MODEL
1. Show progress at the paywall
When they hit workout 5, show them:

"Your bench press is up 10 lbs already"
"You've built a 4-day streak"
"You're 33% stronger in just 2 weeks"

This makes the purchase emotional, not rational.

2. Let them try multiple programs

They can do 4 workouts of Program A
Then try 4 workouts of Program B
But they can't finish any program without paying

Rule: Only 4 free workouts total across ALL programs? Or 4 workouts per program?
My recommendation: 4 workouts per program

Why? They might not like the first program they try
Let them find the right fit
Once they find it, they'll buy


3. Time-limited discount
Complete your 5th workout today and save 20%
Regular: $49.99

Creates urgency without being scammy.

4. Option to pause and switch

Doesn't force them, keeps them engaged.

THE PSYCHOLOGY
This works because of The Endowment Effect:

People value things they already "own"
After 4 workouts, they feel like it's "their program"
They've invested time and effort
Losing access feels like a loss

Combined with Sunk Cost Fallacy:

"I already did 4 workouts, I'm not starting over"
Much more likely to pay than abandon


POTENTIAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
Issue 1: People gaming the system
Problem: User does 4 free workouts, creates new account, repeats
Solution:

Require email verification
Track by device ID (not just account)
After 4 workouts across all accounts on that device, paywall appears

Issue 2: Too generous?
Problem: 4 workouts might be too much free value
Counter: No! 4 workouts = ~2 weeks. Perfect sweet spot.

1-2 workouts: Not enough to see results or build habit
4 workouts: Just enough to get hooked
8+ workouts: Too generous, they might not need more

Issue 3: They abandon after workout 4
Problem: 70% of users quit at the paywall
Solution:

Email sequence: "We noticed you stopped at workout 4..."
Retargeting: "Come back and see your progress"
Limited-time offer: "20% off if you return this week"


PRICING STRATEGY FOR THIS MODEL
Since they're already invested, you can charge more than typical:
Per Program:

$39-$79 depending on length (8-16 weeks)
"Unlock this program: $49"

OR - All Access Pass (better):

$9.99/month or $79/year
"Unlimited access to all programs"
They might buy one program for $49, or get all for $79/year

My recommendation: Offer both

Buy individual program: $49
OR get All Access: $9.99/month
Most will choose All Access (better lifetime value for you)


WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DEVELOPMENT
You need to track:

user_workout_count per program
free_workouts_remaining per program
has_purchased_program[program_id]
has_all_access_pass

Paywall logic:
javascriptif (workoutNumber > 4 && !hasPurchased && !hasAllAccess) {
  showPaywall();
}
